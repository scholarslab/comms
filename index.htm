  <h1>Scholars' Lab Communications Information</h1>

  <p>In the case that external service providers (Slack, Zoom) and University services (email, NetBadge) go down, but Github (where this page is hosted) does not, this is a page to help coordinate communications. Currently, only primary channels are listed, but watch this space if services start to go down.</p>

  <h2>Text/Asynchronous Messaging</h2>
  <ol type="1">
    <li><a href="https://scholarslab.slack.com">Scholars' Lab Slack (primary)</a></li>
  </ol>

  <h2>AV/Synchronous Messaging</h2>
  <ol type="1">
    <li><a href="https://virginia.zoom.us/">UVA Zoom (primary)</a></li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Direct contact</h2>
  <p>Contact information for all staff is listed on a pinned link in the staff-only Slack channel. We'll re-evaluate how to distribute this information if Slack goes down.</p>

  <h2>Communication failure coordination</h2>
  <p> In case of major service disruption, we can meet on the WebRTC service Whereby to discuss how to get back online. Currently, the <a href="https://whereby.com/scholarslab">Scholarslab channel</a> there is on a free plan with a limit of 4 participants, so this should (for now) probably remain reserved for getting alternative channels up.</p>
